# JSON Site Summary

RSS is boring. And old. And, gasp, XML(!) Can't be touching that. And we want Apps these days. With timelines, calendars and metadata. JFFS does this. And approach things Type-Script-first.

JSON Site Summary is a simple format for single endpoint GET API i.e. a single file which provides everything need for a timeline/feed, events and information about a community/company/service/sports club etc. TypeScript.

## Use

For use (right now really only of use with TypeScript as no actual implementation, just type definitions):

```
npm i -D json-site-summary
```

or

```
yarn add -D json-site-summary
```

Just types at the moment, but I'll probably add some kind of validation for build processes.
