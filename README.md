RSS is boring. And old. And, gasp, XML(!) Can't be touching that. And we want Apps these days. With timelines, calendars and metadata. JFFS does this. And approach things Type-Script-first.

JFFS is a simple format for single endpoint GET API i.e. a single file which provides everything need for a timeline/feed, events and information about a community/company/service/sports club etc. TypeScript.

## Use

For use with TypeScript (no actual implementation, just type definitions):

```
